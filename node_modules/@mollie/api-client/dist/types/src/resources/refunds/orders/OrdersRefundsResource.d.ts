     * When using the Orders API, refunds should be made against the Order. When using *pay after delivery* payment methods such as *Klarna Pay later* and *Klarna Slice it*, this ensures that your
     * customer will receive credit invoices with the correct product information on them and generally have a great experience.
     *
     * However, if you want to refund arbitrary amounts you can use the /reference/v2/refunds-api/create-refund for Pay later and Slice it.
     *
     * If an order line is still in the `authorized` status, it cannot be refunded. You should cancel it instead. Order lines that are `paid`, `shipping` or `completed` can be refunded.
     *
     * For more details on how refunds work, see /payments/refunds.
