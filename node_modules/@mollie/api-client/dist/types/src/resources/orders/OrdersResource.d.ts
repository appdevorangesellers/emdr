/**
 * The **Orders API** allows you to use Mollie for your order management.
 *
 * For each order in your shop, you can create an Order via the Mollie API. The order will remain valid for a certain amount of time (default 28 days).
 *
 * Just as a Payment, the Order will have a `_links.checkout` property where you can redirect your customer to pay for the Order. For each attempt to Pay, a Payment is created. If the customer pays
 * for the Order, the Order will transition to the `paid` state (or `authorized` in case of pay after delivery).
 *
 * Should the initial Payment fail, the Order remains in the `created` state so that your customer can try to pay again. This can be done using a dedicated link available through the Dashboard which
 * you can share with your customer, or you can create an additional Payment on the Order via the API.
 *
 * *Pay after delivery* payment methods, such as *Klarna Pay later*, *Klarna Slice it*, and *Vouchers* require the Orders API and cannot be used with the Payments API.
 *
 * Once you ship the goods to your customer, you should inform Mollie of the shipments via the API or via the Dashboard. This is mandatory for pay after delivery methods. Only shipped amounts will be
 * settled to your account.
 *
 * @see https://docs.mollie.com/orders/overview#orders-api
